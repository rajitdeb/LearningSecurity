# LearningSecurity
This repository focuses on learning the security aspect of Android and how to secure API keys

# Steps to secure API Keys in Android
1. Mention the `local.properties` file in the .gitignore file
2. Setting `buildConfig` to true under `buildFeatures` block
3. Pasting the `API_KEY` in `local.properties` file like so: `apiKey = THIS_IS_A_SENSITIVE_API_KEY`
4. Creating a `Properties` object accessing the API_KEY field from `local.properties`:
    ```Kotlin
      val properties = Properties()
      properties.load(project.rootProject.file("local.properties").inputStream())
      buildConfigField("String", "API_KEY", "\"${properties.getProperty("apiKey")}\"")
    ```
5. Rebuild the project
6. Then access the API_KEY with the following code:
   
    ```Kotlin
      val apiKey = BuildConfig.API_KEY
    ```
7. Done

> [!NOTE]
> In order to completely keep your `API_KEY` secured, keep them in the server and make the accessing code server-sided

> [!NOTE]
> No code is fool-proof and can be reverse-engineered but we can definitely prevent it to a large extent

# Understanding Proguard rules
1. Enable R8/Proguard and set `minifyEnabled` to `true` in order to prevent Reverse Engineering (for the release build)
2. Set `shrinkResources` to `true` in order to reduce the file size of the release APK
3. Set `debuggable` to `false` in order to prevent your app to be easily debuggable by unauthorized users
4. Sometimes, it happens that with the usage of proguard, it performs Code Obfuscation on the classes that shouldn't be altered. For example, `model classes`
5. So, we add this code in the `proguard-rules.pro` file:
   
   ```Kotlin
    -keep class com.example.packagename.model.*
   ```
   Alternative approach to do this (applies to folders, sub-folders and its files):
   ```Kotlin
    -keep class com.example.packagename.model.**{*;}
   ```
> [!NOTE]
> Check & add Proguard rules for `every single dependency` (can be found in their respective `GitHub repo` under `Proguard` section) in your application before releasing the app. Or, while working in the project

# How to understand the obfuscated code of our apps?
When we release our app to Google Play Store, and it is distributed to our users, then the users are obviously using the release build. Now, whenever there is a crash that occurs in our app, we won't be apple to understand in which part the crash occurred. So, to overcome this situation, R8/Proguard provides a file to us which demonstrates which file is renamed to what and  we can use it to debug our code. We can find this file as follows:
1. Select `Build -> Select Build Variant`
2. Change the `Active Build Variant` from `debug` to `release`
3. Go to `Build -> Build Bundle(s)/APK(s) -> Build Bundle`
4. After the app bundle is successfully created, switch to `Project` view
5. Then, go to app level `build` folder, go to `outputs -> mapping -> release` and find `mapping.txt` file

> [!NOTE]
> Backup the `mapping.txt` file for every `release` build (every time you press `Build APK/Bundle`), because it creates a different map for every build.
